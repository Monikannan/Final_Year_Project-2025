# Automated Helmet Detection System using Deep Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project aims to develop an **Automated Helmet Detection System** using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It helps identify whether individuals on motorcycles are wearing helmets, promoting road safety and traffic compliance.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - Roboflow (for dataset preparation and annotation)  
  - Google Colab  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
- **Algorithms**:  
  - YOLOv8  
  - YOLOv11  
- **Domain**: Object Detection (Computer Vision)

## 🚀 Methodology
The system leverages object detection algorithms to accurately identify helmets in images and videos. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are trained and tested on a helmet detection dataset prepared using Roboflow.

### 📈 Results
- **YOLOv8 Accuracy**: 97%  
- **YOLOv11 Accuracy**: 95%

## 📦 Installation
> Make sure you have Python 3.x installed

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/helmet-detection-system.git
   cd helmet-detection-system

  
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

**##Usage**
Use YOLOv8.ipynb or YOLOv11.ipynb notebooks to train or evaluate models.

Upload your own images/videos to test helmet detection in real-world scenarios.

Models can be exported for integration into real-time systems like surveillance applications.

**Dataset**
The dataset was prepared and annotated using Roboflow and includes labeled images for:

Person with helmet
Person without helmet
